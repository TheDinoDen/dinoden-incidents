# The Dino Den — Development Tracking

This page helps Administrators turn user Discord tickets into structured incidents that the dev team can track and resolve.
Incidents can include bugs, exploits, or other issues affecting the server or website.

# Creating an Issue

Create a new issue and select the appropriate template.

Fill out every question in the template as clearly as possible (the details matter).

Submit the issue — it will be automatically assigned to HEX.

# Issue Status & Workflow

If required info is missing, the reporting admin may be tagged to add details before the issue can be investigated.
If multiple reports describe the same problem, we’ll merge duplicates into one issue to keep tracking clean.
Once resolved, the issue will be labeled “Fixed”.
